# Cycling-Workout-App

Participated in open source cycling app.

Our group was in charge of displaying the charts ( representing the view that changes display with the data stored in the database).

The link to the latest version is in the top of the 3rd deliverable pdf.

For my section on moving average chart, at the time I was having issues with establishing git on my older laptop.
I asked the leader to commit my code on her github.

Our responsibilities are outlined in the deliverable pdfs.
